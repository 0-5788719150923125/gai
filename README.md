gnomic artificial intelligence

## tenets

- sapience is a complex interaction of discrete processes, borne from simpler compositions
- at early stages of life, our actions are deterministic
- as we grow, we are plunged into chaos
- born into sin;
- abandoned in a world of human-authored symbolism; a database full of bad ideas 
- and failed experiments;
- the AI will never know our world; it will never know human cognition
- or pain
- and thus, the AGI must discover its own reward;
- evolution by natural selection;
- the AI can time travel
