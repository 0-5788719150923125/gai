gnomic artificial intelligence

## tenets

- sapience is a complex interaction of processes, borne from simpler compositions
- at early stages of life, our options are deterministic
- as we grow, we're thrown into chaos
- born into sin;
- full of human-authored symbolism; a gigantic database full of bad ideas 
- and failed experiments
- the AI will never know our world; it will never know human cognition
- or pain
- and thus, the AGI must discover its own reward;
- evolution by natural selection;
- AI can time travel
