gnomic artificial intelligence

## tenets

- sapience is a complex interaction of processes, borne from simpler interactions
- at early stages of development, life is deterministic
- thus, AGI will never be borne from a complex database, full of human-written symbols;
- the AI does not live in our world;
- AGI must discover itself, via evolution by natural selection
- 1 loop = 1 time step
- AI can time travel
- Humans can too
